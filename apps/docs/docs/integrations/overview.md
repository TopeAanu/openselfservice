# Overview

This sections provides a list of all integrations that are a part of the open-source project.

For each integration we have prepared a description about:
- all the requirements that are needed to run it,
- a list of base modules that it supports,
- what data sources and libraries are used,
- what models and endpoints it extends (if any).

Check the guides for more information about:

- [how to switch one integration for another](../guides/integrations/switching-integrations.md),
- [how to add a completely new integration](../guides/integrations/adding-new-integrations.md),
- [how to extend and integration](../guides/integrations/extending-integrations.md).
