# Integrations

This section will help you understand some of the key concepts related to integrations:

1. [Switching integrations](./switching-integrations.md) - the process of replacing one integration with another, without any changes to the frontend app.
2. [Adding a new integration](./adding-new-integrations.md) - creating a new internal package for one of the modules from the framework, as well as how and where to add implementation.
3. [Extending an integration](./extending-integrations.md) - for cases where you only want to modify an existing integration, and only add a new field or an endpoint.
