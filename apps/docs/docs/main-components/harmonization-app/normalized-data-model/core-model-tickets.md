## Data Model Structure

```mermaid

  class Ticket {
  }

  class TicketStatus {
      <<enumeration>>
  }

  class TicketAttachment {
  }

  class TicketComment {
  }

  class Author {
  }

  class TicketProperty {
  }

  Ticket "1" *-- "many" TicketProperty
  Ticket "1" *-- "many" TicketAttachment
  Ticket "1" *-- "many" TicketComment
  TicketAttachment "1" *-- "1" Author
  TicketComment "1" *-- "1" Author
  Ticket "1" --> "1" TicketStatus : status
```

The tickets model is designed to support customer support operations:

1. **Tickets** are the central entity representing customer inquiries
2. **Tickets** have a status that changes as they progress through the support workflow
3. **Tickets** can have attachments and comments for communication
4. **Tickets** can have custom properties for additional metadata

This structure allows for:

- Tracking the status of customer inquiries
- Supporting communication through comments
- Attaching relevant files to tickets
- Adding custom metadata through properties

The pagination utility allows for efficient retrieval of large collections of tickets, supporting standard pagination parameters like offset and limit, as well as filtering by various criteria including date range, status, and type.
