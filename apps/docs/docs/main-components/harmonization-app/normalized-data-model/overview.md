# Overview

This section will give you an overview on:

- what base modules are available within the framework,
- how the normalized data model is defined for each of them,
- and their methods for data fetching and data manipulation.

We will cover every module that is currently supported within the O2S:

- [Organization](./core-model-organization.md) - fetch user's data within their organization hierarchy,
- [Tickets](./core-model-tickets.md) - fetch and submit user tickets, which can cover a variety of cases,
- [Financial](./core-model-financial.md) - fetch user's invoices, and handle their payment,
