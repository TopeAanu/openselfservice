# API Harmonization server

The **API Harmonization server** is the backend layer of O2S, responsible for aggregating, normalizing, and orchestrating
data from multiple APIs. Instead of integrating various services directly into the frontend, the server acts as an
**intermediary** component, ensuring that data is structured in a consistent, API-agnostic format before being consumed by the frontend.

This approach **decouples the frontend from backend dependencies**, enabling flexibility in swapping or modifying integrations
without affecting the UI layer. The server is built using **NestJS** and provides a modular structure for managing integrations efficiently.
